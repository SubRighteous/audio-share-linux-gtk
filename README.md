# AudioShareGtk

**This is an unofficial project developed independently and is not affiliated with the original audio-share project.**
This is a personal project created as a way to learn Rust, GTK 4, and Libadwaita.

AudioShareGtk is a GTK-based graphical front-end for [audio-share](https://github.com/mkckr0/audio-share), originally developed by mkckr0. 
It is a Rust-based GTK 4 desktop application that uses Libadwaita for its user interface, designed to interact with the `audio-share` command-line server to enable audio sharing over a local network.
This project uses the [audio-share Linux server command-line tool](https://github.com/mkckr0/audio-share/releases), which is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
